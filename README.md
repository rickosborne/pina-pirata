This code represents a basic proof of concept for the game logic for the
card game "Pina Pirata".  The code is by Rick Osborne, while the game
is by Donald X Vaccarino and Iello LLC. The game is amusing, and I would
especially recommend it for parents looking to introduce their children
to card games.  You can get more information from Iello:

*This code is not intended to be a functioning, marketable app.*  I am in
no way affiliated with Iello or onyone involved in the game.  I intend
no implication of endorsement.

I wrote it to learn how to write simple games using Ampersand/Backbone.
No infringement of copyright is intended.  To my knowledge, this code
qualifies as fair use as it uses only small pieces of the game and does
not in any way diminish the game's value.

In short: You're welcome to copy and use the code, but you can't sell it,
you need to provide attribution, and you need to make your modifications
to the code available to the public.  This applies even if you refactor
the code to cover a different game, as the license is about the
_implementation via code, not the game itself_.

## Running the code

It should be as simple as cloning the repo then:

```
npm install
node client/app
```

You should get a console full of the AI playing the game.
